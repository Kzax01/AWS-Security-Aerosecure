## 🕵️ AeroSecure Incident Report: **Who is the Intruder?**  

🚀 **Mission:** Protect StratoJet’s **top-secret electric propulsion technology** from cyber threats.  
🔍 **Challenge:** Find the compromised account. 
🛡️ **Your Role:** Follow the clues, analyze the evidence, and uncover the truth.  

---

## **🔒 Project Overview**

### 🚨 **Objective:** 
Simulate and analyze a security breach using **AWS Security Hub** to track and neutralize the threat. 

### 🔍 **Step 1: Enable AWS Security Hub**  
Set up security monitoring across the AWS environment to track and identify critical findings. 🛡️

### 💥 **Step 2: Deploy Honeypots**  
Deploy decoy systems to lure the intruder into triggering alerts. 🎯

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Step 3: Investigate Findings**  
Use **AWS Security Hub** to investigate abnormal patterns and pinpoint the compromised user. 🔎

### ⚡ **Step 4: Execute Remediation**  
Take swift action to neutralize the threat and secure the AWS environment. 🔒

## **🚨 The First Red Flag**  
🔸 AWS Security Hub starts flagging **unusual access patterns**.  
🔸 Data is being accessed at odd hours.  
🔸 Someone is moving **too quietly** through the system.  

Is it just noise? Or is there an **intruder among us?**  

## **🎣 The Trap**  
AeroSecure deploys a **honeypot**—a decoy environment mimicking sensitive propulsion data.  

And then… the intruder takes the bait.  

## **💀 The Breach**  
🔸 Someone is scanning the **honeypot databases**.  
🔸 Files are being copied to **temporary locations**.  
🔸 It’s happening during **business hours**, using legitimate credentials.  

Who is behind this?  

## **🕵️ The Investigation**  
🔎 **One team member** has access beyond their role.  
🔎 Their **background check** reveals inconsistencies.  
🔎 Logs show **unauthorized software** on their workstation.  

Coincidence? Or something **more sinister?**  

## **⚖️ The Verdict**  
🚫 Access revoked.  
🔐 Workstation quarantined.  
📂 Digital forensics launched.  

The truth? **A sophisticated deception.** Someone infiltrated AeroSecure under **false pretenses** ; a plant, a ghost, a mole.  

- Their **real employer? Unknown.**  
- Their **mission? Stolen.**  
- Their **identity? Erased.**

## Key Concepts 📝

| **Term**                  | **Definition**                                                                                         | **Importance**                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Security Hub**       | Centralized service that aggregates findings from multiple AWS services.                               | A single pane of glass to quickly detect and resolve security threats.                                         |
| **Honeypot**               | Decoy systems designed to trap attackers and gather intel on attack methods.                           | Provides valuable insights to strengthen security and trap attackers in controlled environments.             |
| **IAM Key Compromise**     | Leakage or theft of IAM keys, enabling unauthorized access to AWS resources.                           | Protects sensitive data and ensures only authorized users have access to critical resources.                  |
| **EventBridge**            | Serverless event bus service that enables event-driven architecture.                                   | Facilitates automated responses to incidents, reducing manual intervention and accelerating reaction time.     |
