# 📌 GitHub Project: PART 2- Monitoring, Auditing, and Logging Users and Resource Usage in AWS IAM

Welcome to the AWS IAM Access Monitoring Lab! 🚀

## 🔍 Scenario: Access Monitoring for AeroSecure

As a **Cloud Security Engineer** at **AeroSecure**, your mission is to secure sensitive data from satellite communications and critical aviation systems.

### 🚨 The Problem
AeroSecure’s **SOC** team detected suspicious activity: unauthorized login attempts on an AWS account with elevated permissions. This could jeopardize critical resources and data integrity.

### 🎯 The Goal
You’ll implement advanced IAM activity monitoring using **AWS IAM** and **AWS CloudTrail** to:
- ✅ Track access to AWS resources.
- ✅ Detect abnormal or unauthorized activity.
- ✅ Meet compliance standards (ISO 27001, NIST).

## 🔍 Context and Project Importance

| **Concept**           | **Definition**                                                                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS IAM**           | Manages access to AWS resources.                                                    |
| **CloudTrail**        | Logs all AWS account activities for auditing purposes.                              |
| **Access Advisor**    | Analyzes which services IAM users have accessed.                                    |
| **Credential Report** | Lists the status of IAM users' credentials.                                         |

### Why It’s Crucial:
- **Visibility**: Trace all actions on AWS.  
- **Compliance**: Ensure secure identity management and traceability.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Detect suspicious behavior and reduce the risk of data leaks or account compromises.

## 🛠 What We’ll Cover
- Generating an **IAM Credential Report** for auditing.  
- Using **Access Advisor** to identify unused permissions.  
- Setting up **CloudTrail** to monitor activities.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand IAM monitoring techniques.
- Detect unused or insecure access.
- Audit AWS actions for enhanced security.

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- ✅ Active audit trail via **CloudTrail** ensuring traceability for **OrbitalX satellites**.
- 📌 Monitoring of non-compliant access.
- 📌 Optimized IAM permissions.
- 📌 Full compliance with aerospace cybersecurity standards.
