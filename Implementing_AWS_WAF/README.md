## 📌 How to Implement AWS WAF for Web Application Security

Welcome to this new project! 

---

## 🌍 Context: AeroSecure and the Need for Web Security  
In the ever-evolving aerospace industry, real-time data exchange is critical for air traffic controllers, satellite communications, and autonomous drone operations. **Aerosecure**, a leading company specializing in aerospace security, is deploying a **cloud-native web application** to monitor and manage aircraft trajectories in real time.  

However, exposing such a critical application to the internet makes it a prime target for cyber threats, including:  

- **🕵️‍♂️ SQL Injection & XSS**: Hackers attempting to steal flight data.  
- **🌊 DDoS Attacks**: Overloading the system to disrupt real-time tracking.  
- **🎭 HTTP Header Injection**: Redirecting legitimate traffic to malicious sites.  

➡ To safeguard this mission-critical system, **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) is deployed as the first line of defense.

## 🔐 Your Mission: Defend Aerospace Systems from Cyber Attacks  
As a **Cloud Security Engineer**, your task is to implement **AWS WAF** to:  

✅ Block malicious traffic targeting the web application.  
✅ Leverage **AWS Managed Rules** to prevent OWASP Top 10 threats.  
✅ Create a **custom rule** to stop HTTP Header Injection.  
✅ Monitor threats using **AWS CloudWatch Metrics**.
