## Part 1: Setting Up VPC Flow Logs

We'll configure VPC Flow Logs to send data to both S3 and CloudWatch for different analysis capabilities.

### Creating S3 Flow Logs

1. **Create or identify an S3 bucket**
   - Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket or use an existing one
   - Copy the bucket's ARN by selecting the bucket and clicking "Copy ARN"
   

2. **Set up VPC Flow Logs to S3**
   - Navigate to VPC in the AWS console
   - Select your VPC and click on the "Flow logs" tab
   - Click "Create flow log" & name it. Mine was : AeroSecure kzax01
   - Configure the flow log with these settings:
     - Filter: **All**
     - Maximum aggregation interval: **1 minute** (for faster results during testing)
     - Destination: **Send to an Amazon S3 bucket** (I named it S3-logs)
     - S3 bucket ARN: Paste your copied ARN
     - Log record format: **AWS default format**
   - Click "Create flow log"
   

3. **Verify the bucket policy**
   - Return to your S3 bucket and select the "Permissions" tab
   - Notice that AWS automatically updated the bucket policy to allow the VPC Flow Logs service to write to your bucket
   - The policy will include the `s3:PutObject` permission for the Flow Logs service
   

> üí° **Note**: It may take 5-15 minutes for flow logs to start appearing in your S3 bucket.

### Creating CloudWatch Flow Logs

1. **Create a CloudWatch Log Group**
   - Navigate to CloudWatch in the AWS console
   - Go to "Logs" > "Log groups" in the sidebar
   - Click "Create log group"
   - Name your log group (mine is AeroSecureVPCLog)
   - Click "Create"
   
   

2. **Set up VPC Flow Logs to CloudWatch**
   - Return to your VPC and the "Flow logs" tab
   - Click "Create flow log" & name it (Mine was CW-logs)
   - Configure the flow log with these settings:
     - Filter: **All**
     - Maximum aggregation interval: **1 minute**
     - Destination: **Send to CloudWatch Logs**
     - Destination log group: Select your created log group
     - IAM role: Select an existing role with appropriate permissions or create a new one
     - Log record format: **AWS default format**
   - Click "Create flow log"
   

3. **Verify your flow logs**
   - On the VPC "Flow logs" tab, you should now see two Active flow logs‚Äîone sending to S3 and another to CloudWatch
   - Navigate to your CloudWatch Log Group to see if log streams are being created (remember, this may take a few minutes)

## Part 2: Generating Network Traffic

To generate meaningful flow logs, we need to create some network traffic, including both successful and rejected connections.

1. **Connect to your EC2 instance** - AeroSecure Server 
   - Navigate to EC2 in the AWS console
   - Create your instance and copy its Public IPv4 address ( Be sure to enable the auto-assign Ipv4)
   - Open a terminal and connect via SSH:
     ```
     ssh user@<public-ip-address>
     ```
   - Once connected, log out using the `logout` command
   

2. **Generate rejected traffic**
   - In the EC2 console, select your instance (AeroSecure Server)
   - Go to Actions > Security > Change security groups
   - Remove the security group that allows SSH access (typically port 22)
   - Add a security group that only allows HTTP (port 80)
   - Try to connect to your instance again via SSH‚Äîthis connection will time out and generate a REJECT record in your flow logs
   - Cancel the SSH attempt with Ctrl+C
   

3. **Restore SSH access**
   - Go back to your instance's security groups
   - Revert to the original security group that allows SSH
   - Connect to your instance again via SSH to verify access is restored
   

> üîÑ This process of allowing and blocking SSH access generates both ACCEPT and REJECT records in your VPC Flow Logs, which we'll use for monitoring and analysis.

## Part 3: Monitoring and Alerting

Now that we have flow logs data and have generated some traffic, let's create monitoring and alerting systems.

### Creating CloudWatch Metric Filters

1. **Access your CloudWatch Log Group**
   - Navigate to CloudWatch > Logs > Log groups
   - Select your VPC Flow Logs log group
   - Verify that log streams are now visible
   

2. **Create a Metric Filter for SSH rejections**
   - Select the "Metric filters" tab and click "Create metric filter"
   - In the "Filter pattern" field, enter:
     ```
     [version, account, eni, source, destination, srcport, destport="22", protocol="6", packets, bytes, windowstart, windowend, action="REJECT", flowlogstatus]
     ```
   - This pattern will detect rejected SSH connection attempts (port 22, TCP protocol)
   - Click "Next" after testing the pattern
   

3. **Configure the metric details**
   - Filter name: **dest-port-22-reject**
   - Metric namespace: **AeroSecureVPCLog** (or another name of your choice)
   - Metric name: **SSH Rejects**
   - Metric value: **1** (this counts each matching event as 1)
   - Click "Next" and then "Create metric filter"
   

### Setting Up CloudWatch Alarms

1. **Create an alarm based on your metric filter**
   - From the "Metric filters" tab, select your newly created filter
   - Click "Create alarm" & name it. Mine was Rejects-alert
   - Configure the alarm conditions:
     - Period: **1 minute**
     - Threshold type: **Static**
     - Condition: **Greater/Equal than 1**
     - This will trigger when there's at least one SSH rejection per minute
     

2. **Configure alert notifications**
   - Select "Create a new topic" for SNS notifications
   - Enter your email address for notifications
   - Confirm the subscription via the email you receive
   - Name your alarm (e.g., "SSH rejects")
   - Review and create the alarm
   

3. **Test your alarm**
   - Generate more rejected SSH traffic by changing the security group again
   - Wait a few minutes for the data to propagate
   - Check your alarm status‚Äîit should change to "In alarm"
   - You should receive an email notification about the alarm

## Part 4: Data Analysis

Now let's explore how to analyze the VPC Flow Logs data using different AWS services.

### Using CloudWatch Logs Insights

1. **Run a query with Logs Insights**
   - Navigate to CloudWatch > Logs > Logs Insights
   - Select your VPC Flow Logs log group
   - Use the sample queries for VPC Flow Logs or create your own
   - Try the "Top 20 source IP addresses with highest number of rejected requests" query
   - Click "Run query" and analyze the results

### Analyzing Data with Athena

1. **Create an Athena table for your flow logs**
   - Navigate to your S3 bucket with flow logs
   - Navigate through the folder structure (AWSLogs/account-id/AeroSecureVPCLog/region/year/month/day)
   - Copy the S3 URI for this path
   - Go to Athena and launch the query editor
   - Configure Athena settings to store query results in your S3 bucket
   

2. **Create the table structure**
   - Run the following SQL query, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS default.vpc_flow_logs (
        version int,
     account string,
     interfaceid string,
     sourceaddress string,
     destinationaddress string,
     sourceport int,
     destinationport int,
     protocol int,
     numpackets int,
     numbytes bigint,
     starttime int,
     endtime int,
     action string,
     logstatus string
     ) PARTITIONED BY (
     dt string
     ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' ' LOCATION 's3://{your_log_bucket}/AWSLogs/{account_id}/vpcflowlogs/us-east-1/' TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
     ```
_You'll need to add your S3 bucket URL but this time; it should end by your region : mine is us-east-1_

‚û° Then you do ctrl + enter, & it'll run your query automatically.


3. **Add a partition for your data**
   - Run the following SQL to add a partition for today's date:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE default.vpc_flow_logs
     ADD PARTITION (dt='YYYY-MM-DD')
     location 's3://{your-log-bucket}/AWSLogs/{account-id}/vpcflowlogs/us-east-1/YYYY/MM/DD/';
     ```
   - Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the actual date
   

4. **Query and analyze your data**
   - Run an analytical query on your flow logs:
     ```sql
     SELECT day_of_week(from_iso8601_timestamp(dt)) AS day,
       dt,
       interfaceid,
       sourceaddress,
       destinationport,
       action,
       protocol
     FROM vpc_flow_logs
     WHERE dt = '2025-03-17'  -- Filtre sur la partition correcte
     AND action = 'REJECT' 
     AND protocol = 6
     ORDER BY sourceaddress
     LIMIT 100;
     ```
   - This query shows rejected TCP connections (protocol 6), ordered by source IP address
   
‚û°Ô∏è Then you'll see Athena analysing all the queries related to "REJECT" action as requested earlier. 
Athena is a powerful tool for analysis.
