# 📌 Creating and Securing Customer Managed Keys with AWS KMS

Welcome back to this exciting project! 

## 🎯 The Mission :
As we seen earlier, the scenario focuses on ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data stored in **Amazon S3** for **AeroSecure**, where your task is to enable encryption using **AWS KMS**, apply it to an S3 bucket, and implement key deletion scheduling for effective lifecycle management.

# ⚙️ Project's Steps  

## 🔹 1. Creating an S3 Bucket  
📍 **Actions:**  
1. Navigate to **Amazon S3** > Create a bucket.  
2. Provide a **unique name** for the bucket.  
3. Keep the **default settings** and create the bucket.  

📌 **Why?**  
The bucket will be used to store **sensitive files**, which will be encrypted with **AWS KMS**.  

## 🔹 2. Creating a Symmetric KMS Key  
📍 **Actions:**  
1. Go to **AWS KMS** > Create a key.  
2. Select **Symmetric Key** and **Encrypt/Decrypt**.  
3. Choose **Single-Region Key** (AeroSecure’s security requirement).  
4. Assign an **alias** to the key (e.g., `cloud_user`).  
5. Define **key administrators** (e.g., `Kzax01`).  
6. Apply the **access control policy**.  
7. Create the key.  


➡️ FYI  I used this policy :
```
{
  "Id": "key-consolepolicy-3",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:root"
      },
      "Action": "kms:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Allow access for Key Administrators",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/<username>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Create*",
        "kms:Describe*",
        "kms:Enable*",
        "kms:List*",
        "kms:Put*",
        "kms:Update*",
        "kms:Revoke*",
        "kms:Disable*",
        "kms:Get*",
        "kms:Delete*",
        "kms:TagResource",
        "kms:UntagResource",
        "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
        "kms:CancelKeyDeletion",
        "kms:RotateKeyOnDemand"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
    
> This policy grants full access to AWS KMS actions for the root user of the specified AWS account. 
It also allows a specific IAM user to manage key-related actions, including creating, updating, deleting, and rotating keys, but restricts them to those specific KMS operations.


📌 **Why?**  
This key will encrypt **sensitive files** in S3 and restrict access using **IAM/KMS policies**.  

## 🔹 3. Attaching the KMS Key to the S3 Bucket (SSE-KMS Encryption)  
📍 **Actions:**  
1. Navigate to **S3**, select the bucket.  
2. Go to the **Properties** tab.  
3. In **Default Encryption**, click **Edit**.  
4. Select **Server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS)**.  
5. Choose the **created KMS key** (`alias/cloud_user`).  
6. Enable **Bucket Key** to reduce KMS access costs.  
7. Save the changes.  

📌 **Why?**  
Ensures that all **uploaded objects** in this bucket are automatically **encrypted** using the defined **KMS key**.  

## 🔹 4. Encryption Verification  
📍 **Actions:**  
1. Upload a file to the **S3 bucket**.  
2. Click on the file and go to **Server-side encryption settings**.  
3. Verify that **SSE-KMS** with the **alias/cloud_user** key is applied.  

📌 **Why?**  
This ensures that all **stored objects** are properly **protected** by AWS KMS.  

## 🔹 5. Scheduling the Deletion of the KMS Key  
📍 **Actions:**  
1. Go back to **AWS KMS**.  
2. Select the **cloud_user** key.  
3. Navigate to **Key Actions** > **Schedule Key Deletion**.  
4. Set a **waiting period** (between **7 and 30 days**).  
5. Check the confirmation box and confirm deletion.  

📌 **Why?**  
A **deleted key** makes all **encrypted data permanently inaccessible**.  
The **waiting period** allows cancellation in case of an error.

# ⚠️ Constraints and Considerations  

## 🔹 KMS Key Deletion:  
- Once a key is **permanently deleted**, files encrypted with it **cannot be accessed**.  
- Deletion can be **canceled** as long as the **waiting period (7-30 days)** has not expired.  

## 🔹 Using the Bucket Key:  
- Reduces costs by **minimizing calls** to AWS KMS.  
- **Not compatible** with **DSSE-KMS** (Double Server-Side Encryption).  

## 🔹 Security & IAM:  
- Always **restrict** access to **KMS keys** with a **strict IAM policy**.  
- **Never** expose a **KMS key** to **public access**.

# 🎯 Summary of Completed Actions  
✅ Created an **S3 bucket** for storing **sensitive files**.  
✅ Created and configured a **KMS key** for **data encryption**.  
✅ Enabled **SSE-KMS encryption** on the S3 bucket.  
✅ Verified that **encryption** is properly applied.  
✅ Scheduled the **KMS key deletion** for **secure lifecycle management**.

# 🏆 Conclusion  
You have successfully **secured AeroSecure’s sensitive data** by implementing **strong encryption** with **AWS KMS and Amazon S3**. 🚀  
This type of implementation is **critical in aerospace**, where protecting **communications and critical systems** is a top priority.
