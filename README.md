## 👩‍💻 Who Am I?  

Hi there! I’m Kenza, a **Cloud Security Engineer** and an **AWS Community Builder in Security & Identity**. 
My journey in the Cloud & Cybersecurity has always been driven by a deep curiosity for **high-stakes industries** where security is **not an option, but a necessity**.  

## 🌍 Why Aerospace? Why Cloud Security?  

The aerospace industry has always **fascinated** me. It’s a world of **precision, innovation, and cutting-edge technology**, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. But as this sector rapidly embraces digital transformation, one challenge stands out: **cybersecurity**.  

That’s how **AeroSecure** was born : A project at the crossroads of my passion for aerospace and cloud security [AWS].

## 🔥 Cybersecurity in Aerospace: High Stakes, Real Threats  

The aerospace sector is **under attack**, and the risks are higher than ever:  

- 🏭 **Supply Chain Attacks** – One weak supplier can compromise an entire system.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Misconfigurations** – A single misstep can expose critical infrastructure.  
- 💰 **Ransomware & Data Breaches** – Airlines, manufacturers, and even space agencies are prime targets.  
- 🛰 **Satellite Hacking** – Communication disruptions, GPS spoofing... yes, it’s happening.  
- 📜 **Regulatory Pressure** – Compliance (DO-326A, NIST, EASA) is key, but compliance alone won’t stop hackers.
